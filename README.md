# Apple Store Dataset SQL Project

By: Steven Nguyen

## Introduction

In this project I will use SQL Lite to explore and analyze data and provide insights to the stakeholder.

## Objective

An aspiring developer aims to create apps for the Apple App Store and seeks data-driven insights to determine which app to build. To provide valuable insights to my stakeholder, I will address questions such as:
	1.What App Categories are the most popular?
	2.What price should the stakeholder set for his app?
	3.How Can he maximize users rating?
	4.Is there any trends that is seen in the database?
